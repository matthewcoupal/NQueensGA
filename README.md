# CIS 421 - Assignment 2 #

### How do I get set up? ###
All classes needed for compilation are within the `NQueensGA.java` file.

To compile, run `javac NQueensGA.java` in the terminal.
To run, type `java NQueensGA` in the terminal.

To access class and method documentation in an organized manner, run JavaDoc by running `javadoc -private NQueensGA.java`. For all other comments, you must view the source code. 

*Note:* I would suggest creating a new directory where `NQueens.java` is located and running `javadoc -private ../NQueens.java` to keep things neat.

The parameters are as follows:

- Board Size: 12
- Mutation Chance: 10%
- Max Generations: 1000
- Population Size: 12 * 12
